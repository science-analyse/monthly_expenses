## Critical Insights for Better Financial Health

### 1. The Coffee & Dining Pattern

**The Reality:** Combined spending on Coffee (₼14,382) and Restaurants (₼18,848) totals **₼33,230** - that's **34.3%** of all expenses.

**What This Means:**

### 2. The Small Transaction Trap

![Spending Distribution by Percentile](charts/spending_percentiles.png)

**Key Finding:** **66% of your transactions are under ₼10** - these "micro-expenses" add up significantly.

**The Psychology:** Small purchases feel harmless but accumulate rapidly. Your data shows:
- Transactions under ₼10: 3,996 purchases
- Total impact: Approximately ₼28,000 over the period
- These often go unnoticed and untracked

**Action Item:** Implement a "daily spending cap" for small purchases to regain control.

### 3. Monthly Spending Volatility

**Pattern Identified:** Your spending varies significantly month-to-month (from ₼1,018 to ₼5,509).

**What's Happening:**

- **July 2024** spike suggests vacation or major purchase
- **November 2022** shows you CAN maintain lower spending

**Stability Strategy:** Target your proven low of ₼1,800/month as a sustainable goal - this alone could save you **₼561/month**.

### 4. Category Spending Evolution

![Category Spending Trends Over Time](charts/category_trends.png)

**Trend Analysis:**
- Restaurant and Coffee spending remain consistently high
